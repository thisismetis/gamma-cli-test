# Sample Lesson Plan

- [Prime pair](pairs/prime) (**very strongly suggested pair to be completed just before this lesson**)
- (30 m) [Code Style Deck](code-style.pdf)
- (15 m) [Code Style Exercise](style-exercise.md)

# Learning Objectives

Students can
- Evaluate the style of code.
- Apply a style guide to their own code.
- Use style tools to improve their code:
    - Use a CLI linter
    - Use an IDE linter
    - Use a CLI formatter
    - Use an IDE/Jupyter formatter
- Write code that speaks for itself.
- Import external functions into Jupyter.

# Instructor Notes

Code style is a notoriously opinionated area. I've tried to write this to have universal appeal. We aren't advocating for anything specific here, just making the case for styled code in general. Instructors are encouraged to speak frankly about their own experience with both good and sloppy code.

The suggested pair and style exercise are designed to give students hands-on experience using external functions in Jupyter and using a balance between Jupyter code and external code to improve communication in their projects.
