# Instructor Notes

This notebook introduces the powerful parts of numpy and using arrays. This
notebook has one exercise embedded. It's a bit of an abstract exercise, so you
should warn the students that it's not particularly "useful" but is focused on
making them wrestle with filtering and broadcasting. The notebook also has a few
leading questions baked in throughout.
