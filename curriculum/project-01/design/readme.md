# Sample Lesson Plan
* (15m) [Iterative Design Process](design-process.key)
* (15m) Group Discussion


# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students should know:
* To start with a question instead of the data
* What an MVP is and the importance of starting small and iterating


# Depends On

None


# Instructor Notes

After we give students their Project 1 assignment on day 1, most students dive right into the data and they struggle. On day 2, the goal is to show them a better approach.

The second half of this presentation will bleed into project work time. Give students some time to discuss what they've just learned within their groups. You should be hearing a lot more brainstorming now.

**Note:** This lecture will most likely not fit into the morning lecture time slot, and will need to be in the afternoon.


# Additional Resources
The latest presentation (09/2018) incorporates ideas from Bo Peng's design process notes and Sophie Searcy's iterative design principles presentation deck.
