# gamma-cli
The command line tool for the gamma curriculum

# Installation

This tool is maintained behind a private repo, so it is not hosted on the python package index. If you have [SSH keys set up with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) (which is recommended anyway) then the following should work

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/thisismetis/gamma-cli.git#egg=gamma
```

If you have trouble with this, you may clone this repo and install from that repo like so (You must be `cd`d into the cloned repo for the following to work.)

```
pip install .
```
