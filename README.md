# gamma-cli
The command line tool for the gamma curriculum

# Installation

This tool is maintained behind a private repo, so it is not hosted on the python package index. Assuming you have SSH keys set up with github, you may install it via

```bash
pip install -e git+git@github.com:thisismetis/gamma-cli.git#egg=gamma
```

If you have trouble with this, you may clone this repo and install from that repo like so (You must be `cd`d into the cloned repo for the following to work.)

```
pip install .
```
